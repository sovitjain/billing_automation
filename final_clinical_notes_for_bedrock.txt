HPI:
PFPT : Pelvic Pain Urogyn This is her first PFPT session in the setting of nocturia . She was recommended to begin pelvic floor physical therapy in the setting of pelvic pain as studies have shown that providing constant stimulation at 200 Hz to the pelvic floor muscles serves to relax the pelvic floor. This is important because often times pelvic pain is either the result or cause of hyptertonic and/or spastic pelvic floor muscles. Thus, by relaxing the pelvic floor muscles through pelvic floor physical therapy, pelvic pain symptoms are often reduced and in some cases eliminated. .

PFPT Details:
PFPT : Pelvic Pain Urogyn This is her first PFPT session in the setting of nocturia . She was recommended to begin pelvic floor physical therapy in the setting of pelvic pain as studies have shown that providing constant stimulation at 200 Hz to the pelvic floor muscles serves to relax the pelvic floor. This is important because often times pelvic pain is either the result or cause of hyptertonic and/or spastic pelvic floor muscles. Thus, by relaxing the pelvic floor muscles through pelvic floor physical therapy, pelvic pain symptoms are often reduced and in some cases eliminated. . Objective: Examination: General Examination: PFPT - PAIN We discussed that PFPT will consist of both diagnostic and therapeutic components. For the diagnostic portion, the patient will be asked to squeeze her pelvic floor muscles while we obtain measurements during the squeezes. These measurements will include vaginal EMG readings, accessory muscle performance measurements, and anorectal manometry. Each of these readings will serve to record progress from week to week in terms of pelvic floor muscle relaxation. After the diagnostic readings are recorded, the therapy itself will commence. Electrical stimulation will be delivered through the vaginal probe in a constant fashion to activate the pelvic floor muscles at 200 Hz with the purpose of fatiguing the pelvic floor muscles. Purpose of vaginal EMG: The purpose of vaginal EMG readings are to measure muscle activity during activation and relaxation periods of the pelvic floor muscles. We will be looking for a consistent baseline on graph documentation with an increase in pelvic floor muscle activity when asked to activate the pelvic floor muscles. Proper relaxation should also be noted in between activation periods. Purpose of accessory muscle performance: Abdominal sensors are used in pelvic floor physical therapy to ensure that there is no activation of the abdominal muscles during periods of pelvic floor muscle activation. This serves to indicate that there is proper pelvic floor muscle isolation during periods of activity. Purpose of anorectal manometry: An anal pressure probe is used during the diagnostic portion of pelvic floor physical therapy to assess the pure pelvic floor muscle strength and endurance. Anorectal manometry deferred We will look for patterns and trends in pelvic floor muscle relaxation/strength from week to week to objectively measure treatment success. . Assessment: Assessment: 1. Pelvic pain - R10.2 (Primary) Plan: Treatment: 1. Others Clinical Notes: Plan of care: Patients are prescribed an initial course of 6-8 weekly sessions for optimal symptom improvement. We will plan to follow up regarding progress each week and adjust the plan of care accordingly. She was instructed to continue at home pelvic floor muscle exercises. She is to continue bladder diet as well. Return to office in one week for next session. Will follow up regarding continued symptom improvement at that point. We spent 15 minutes in face-to-face discussion. More than 50% of this time was spent in counseling the patient. Billing Information: Visit Code: 99213 Office Visit, Est Pt., Level 3.
