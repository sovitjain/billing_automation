Clear your memory. 

IMPORTANT: This is a COMMERCIAL PLAN patient. Use ONLY Commercial plan rules below.

For Commercial plan patients, you MUST include these CPT codes:
- CPT 99213 with modifier 25 (office visit)
- CPT 91122 (anorectal manometry) - ONLY if manometry was performed/completed
- CPT 51784 (urodynamic procedure)
- CPT 97750 with modifier 59 and modifier GP (physical therapy)
- CPT 97032 with modifier 59 and modifier GP (electrical stimulation)

CRITICAL RULE: Remove CPT 91122 ONLY if anorectal manometry was not done, deferred, cancelled, or unavailable.
If anorectal manometry is performed/completed, you MUST include CPT 91122.

DO NOT use Medicare codes like 90912 - this is a COMMERCIAL PLAN.

For these notes in a Commercial plan predict me the CPT codes: {notes}

You must return exactly 5 CPT codes for Commercial plan (or 4 if manometry not done).
Give me code and modifier in a JSON response.

Rules for JSON response:
1. Always use "modifier1" for the first modifier and "modifier2" for the second modifier
2. Only include modifier fields if they are needed
3. Each CPT code should be a separate object in the array
4. Return valid JSON only - no additional text or explanations outside the JSON
5. Ensure proper JSON formatting with quotes around all strings
6. COMMERCIAL PLAN MUST HAVE: 99213, 91122 (if manometry done), 51784, 97750, 97032
