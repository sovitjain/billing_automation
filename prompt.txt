Remove cpt 91122 if Anorectal manometry was not done, deferred, cancelled, or unavailable

For these notes in a Commercial plan predict me the cpt code: {notes}. Give me code and modifier, in a json response. 

IMPORTANT: If the notes mention that Anorectal manometry was "deferred", "cancelled", "not available", "not done", or any similar language, DO NOT include CPT 91122 even if it appears in a procedure codes list. Only include CPT 91122 if the notes clearly indicate that Anorectal manometry was actually performed. 

You decide based on the clinical narrative whether the Anorectal manometry was actually done or not. I am going to use output programmatically.

Rules for JSON response:
1. Always use "modifier1" for the first modifier and "modifier2" for the second modifier
2. Only include modifier fields if they are needed
3. Each CPT code should be a separate object in the array
4. Return valid JSON only - no additional text or explanations outside the JSON
5. Ensure proper JSON formatting with quotes around all strings
