For these notes in a Medicare plan predict me the cpt code: {notes}. Give me code and modifier, in a json response.

Rules for JSON response:
1. Always use "modifier1" for the first modifier and "modifier2" for the second modifier
2. Only include modifier fields if they are needed
3. Each CPT code should be a separate object in the array
4. Return valid JSON only - no additional text or explanations outside the JSON
5. Ensure proper JSON formatting with quotes around all strings
